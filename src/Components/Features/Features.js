          Suits are well-coordinated ethnic sets, which usually consist of a

          Suits for women come in a variety of shapes, including the straight
          ones, Ankarkalis, A-line fits, Angarkhas, and many more. Additionally,
          these suits are crafted in the finest fabrics like cotton, silk,
          georgette, velvet, and even wool.
